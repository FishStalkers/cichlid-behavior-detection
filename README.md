# cichlid-behavior-detection
an ML model to classify behavior in African Cichlids, used in the McGrath Lab @ GT Biology Sciences <br /><br />
improves automated behavior detection & classification system by using pose estimation to extract mating and aggressive behaviors rather than using sand change, the current methodology in use.<br /><br />
